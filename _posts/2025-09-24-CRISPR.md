CRISPR Therapeutics was founded in 2013 by Emmanuelle Charpentier, Shaun Foy, and Rodger Novak. Emmanuelle Charpentier won the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 2020 with Jennifer Doudna. The company was initially funded by a Series A investment of $25 million from Versant Ventures. For the fiscal year 2024, the company's revenue was reported as $37.3 million.
The company's primary business is to use its proprietary CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing platform to research, develop, and commercialize transformative, gene-based medicines. Their focus is on treating serious diseases at the molecular level. A key part of their business model involves strategic collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies, such as Vertex Pharmaceuticals and Bayer, to share the costs and risks of drug development. The future success of CRISPR Therapeutics is closely tied to the clinical and commercial performance of its gene-editing platform.
