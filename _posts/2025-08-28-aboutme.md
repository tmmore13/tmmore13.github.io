My name is Timothy Moore, my majoris Management information systems, and my estimated graduation date is 2029.
My plan for my future is to get a job in IT or business and have a house with a family and lots of cats
Some of my hobbies are photography, video games, tv shows, cars.
My favorite subject in college so far has been economics, just because my teacher is very nice honestly.
